| # | Date | Slug | Outcome | Delta |
|---|------|------|---------|-------|
| ▸ 1 | 2026-05-28 | vision-to-destination-rename | artifact `.trail/vision.md` renamed to `.trail/destination.md` to match the renamed Destination skill (was Vision; now at `destination/SKILL.md` v2.0.0 in the skills suite, commit e3d1577). H1 header updated to match; no other content in destination.md was modified — it remains operator-held. | artifact filename only; skill behaviour unchanged. |

### Run 1 — 2026-05-28 — vision-to-destination-rename

- **decided:** Run the mechanical migration in harness-protocol: `git mv .trail/vision.md .trail/destination.md`, update the H1 header line only, leave the rest of the file untouched (operator-held content per the vision-management discipline), append this entry, regenerate derived artifacts, commit only the migration-related files, push.
