## 2026-05-28 — vision-to-destination-rename

- target: harness-protocol
- operator: Nils Holmager
- agent: GitHub Copilot (Claude Opus 4.7 via vertex)
- skill: improve (intent at step 1, trail at step 7)
- session-file: (fleet sweep coordinated from autonomous-agent-skills repo; see that repo's .trail/sessions/2026-05-28-rename-vision-to-destination.md and audit-trail entry of the same date for cross-cutting rationale, rejected alternatives, and reversals)
- fidelity: reconstructed
- outcome: artifact `.trail/vision.md` renamed to `.trail/destination.md` to match the renamed Destination skill (was Vision; now at `destination/SKILL.md` v2.0.0 in the skills suite, commit e3d1577). H1 header updated to match; no other content in destination.md was modified — it remains operator-held.
- delta: artifact filename only; skill behaviour unchanged.

### Interpretation of the ask

Operator asked the skills-suite agent to find every repo carrying the legacy `.trail/vision.md` and migrate it to the canonical filename so the read-destination-then-fall-back-to-vision rule in `destination/SKILL.md` v2.0.0 stops being load-bearing across the active repos. Eight repos were found. This entry records the migration for **harness-protocol**.

### Decision

[!DECISION] Run the mechanical migration in harness-protocol: `git mv .trail/vision.md .trail/destination.md`, update the H1 header line only, leave the rest of the file untouched (operator-held content per the vision-management discipline), append this entry, regenerate derived artifacts, commit only the migration-related files, push.

Rejected alternatives (recorded in the skills-suite entry, not duplicated here): hard-rename without a fallback period (would have broken consumers), keep the legacy filename forever (permanent skill/artifact name mismatch), and the two sibling skill renames Retrospect→Plan and Improve→Execute (both would have imported PM vocabulary that contradicts what each skill produces).

### Prediction

Commit lands cleanly. Pre-existing uncommitted WIP (if any) is untouched. The next Destination, Retrospect, or Improve run on harness-protocol reads `.trail/destination.md` directly without invoking the fallback path.

### Action

1. `git mv .trail/vision.md .trail/destination.md`.
2. Updated the H1 header via UTF-8-safe .NET `File.ReadAllText` / `File.WriteAllText` to avoid the PowerShell 5.1 Get-Content/Set-Content mojibake on em-dashes (logged in skills-suite userMemory `append-only-trails.md`).
3. Appended this trail entry via `Add-Content -Encoding UTF8` (append-only rule).
4. Regenerated `.trail/history.md` and `.trail/learning.md` via the skills-suite `record.py` invoked with this repo as cwd.
5. Staged and committed only the migration-related files (`.trail/destination.md`, `.trail/audit-trail.md`, `.trail/history.md`, `.trail/learning.md`). Any pre-existing uncommitted WIP in harness-protocol was left in the working tree untouched. Pushed.

### Reflection

**Falsifiable model-claim:** harness-protocol's operator-held destination now lives at the canonical filename. A future agent does not need the legacy-fallback path to read it. If a future entry in this trail references reading `.trail/vision.md`, something has regressed.

**Named blind spot:** this migration was mechanical and did not evaluate whether the *content* of harness-protocol's destination is still accurate. A stale destination is a different problem from a stale filename; this run fixed only the filename.

**Imagined-reader pushback:** "You touched my repo without doing the work I had open in it." Counter: the rename is the minimum needed to drop the deprecation clock attached to the legacy filename, the only edit inside `destination.md` was the H1 line (the suffix and the rest of the operator content were preserved verbatim), the commit only stages the four migration-related files, and any pre-existing uncommitted WIP remains in the working tree exactly as it was.

**Across-trail trigger evaluation:**

- *Recurring finding-class:* not fired — first fleet rename in this repo's trail; no pattern.
- *About to declare silence:* not fired — substantive action taken.
- *Contradicts prior [!REALIZATION]:* not fired — no prior realisation in this repo argued for or against the artifact filename.
- *Operator explicitly asked:* FIRED — operator explicitly asked for the migration after the skill rename was committed in the skills suite.

### Candidate Next Moves

1. **Run the Destination skill on harness-protocol** to check whether the operator-held destination is still current; this migration only fixed the filename, not the substance.
2. **Run Retrospect on harness-protocol's trail** — the migration changes nothing structural, but a Retrospect pass would surface any arc-level claim that had become stale while attention was elsewhere.
3. **Confirm no other tooling in harness-protocol still hard-codes the path `.trail/vision.md`** (e.g., a checked-in workflow, a script, a doc) — `record.py` and the skill prose already read the new name, but harness-protocol-local tooling has not been audited in this run.
